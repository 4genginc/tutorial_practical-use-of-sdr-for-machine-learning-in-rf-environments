-   [https://acmse.net/2022/tutorials-offered/](https://acmse.net/2022/tutorials-offered/)

**Presenter**: Neel Pandeya (National Instruments in Austin – USA), Debashri Roy (Northeastern University – USA), Tathagata Mukherjee (University of Alabama in Huntsville – USA)
**Type of Event**: Tutorial
**Date**: Monday, April 18, 2022
**Time**: 12:30–15:30 (Central Time)
**Duration**: 3 hours
**Room**: Room 2

**Abstract**:
In this tutorial we will introduce software defined radios (SDR) and explore the application of machine learning (ML) to radio frequency (RF) systems. An explanation of the SDR hardware and the software tool-chain will be given. Several practical demonstrations will be shown to illustrate the usage and operation of the programmable radios. We will then introduce the basics of radio frequency (RF) machine learning (ML) using software defined radios, and demonstrate the implementation of end-to-end RF ML systems using deep neural networks.

**Keywords**:
Software Defined Radios (SDR), USRP, Machine Learning, Radio Frequency (RF).

**Covered Topics**:
We will use Python extensively for the example applications. Python libraries, such as SciPy, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, as well as GNU Radio, will be used in the example code. We will also provide code for integrating the ML systems with the USRP B210 radio from Ettus Research/National Instruments. The following topics will be covered:

-   Introduction to signal processing concepts for SDR, USRP radio hardware architecture, UHD device driver and UHD API, and GNU Radio
-   Configuration of the USRP Radio
-   Demos and examples of various SDR systems
-   Discussion of FM radio-based positioning using SDR
-   Introduction to ML Concepts
-   Introduction to Adversarial Learning
-   RF ML Problems and Challenges
-   Introduction to the Transmitter Identification problem
-   Example of Transmitter Identification using Python Jupyter notebook

**Prerequisites for Participants:**
Attendees should have an understanding of algebra, probability, the Linux command line, and basic Python programming.
